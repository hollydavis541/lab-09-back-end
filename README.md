**Author**: Holly Davis and Lindsay Peltier  
**Version**: 1.1.0
<!-- (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission) -->

## Overview
Create a node.js server that connects to APIs that provide weather, events, restaurants, and movie showing information to the City Explorer site. 

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it to your computer
3. In your command line: $ touch .env
4. Add the following to your .env file and save
PORT = 3000
GEOCODE_API_KEY = "[your api goes here]"
WEATHER_API_KEY = "[your api goes here]"
EVENT_API_KEY = "[your api goes here]"
5. Confirm that node is installed: $ node -v (if not installed, do so)
6. To start your server: $ nodemon
7. Go to city-explorer-code301.netlify.com and enter "http://localhost:3000" in the field. Search for a city and you should see the location and weather information. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

This is a Node.js server that uses express, dotenv, and cors packages. The server currently references two json data files in order to provide information to the client.
